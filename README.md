# TournamentTester
My version of Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree "Tournament" project(P2).

This backend database program  is a good boilerplate for coding a
tournament match functionality in your app. It has all of the logic
necessary to manage a tournament in the popular "Swiss Tournament" style.

##Installation:
  1. **Install all requirements.**
  2. Download the contents of this repo.
  3. Open command prompt.
  4. Enter `cd [directory of your choice] && python tournament_init.py`
  5. Some console messages should print, ending with "Success! All tests pass!"
  6. You may now run any of the functions inside `tournament.py`
  7. Profit!

##Requirements:
  * Python2 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * Install PostgreSQL (http://www.postgresql.org/)
  * Install SQLAlchemy (http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
   (If you run vagrant and git, you can just:
   `git clone https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm.git fullstack`
   and `vagrant up`.)
