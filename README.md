# TournamentTester
My version of Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree "Tournament" project(P2).

This backend database program  is a good boilerplate for coding a
tournament match functionality in your app. It has all of the logic
necessary to manage a tournament in the popular "Swiss Tournament" style.

Installation:
To run this backend database, you must:
  1. Install all requirements.
  2. Download the contents of this repo.
  3. Open command prompt.
  4. Enter "cd [directory of your choice] && python tournament_init.py"
  5. Some console messages should print, ending with "Success! All tests pass!"
  6. Peek inside tournament.py
  7. Profit!
