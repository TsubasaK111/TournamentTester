# TournamentTester
My version of Udacity's Full Stack Nanodegree "Tournament" project(P2).

This backend database program  is a good boilerplate for coding a
tournament match functionality in your app. It has all of the logic
necessary to manage a tournament in the popular "Swiss Tournament" style.

To run this backend database, you must:
  1. Install Python2 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  2. Install PostgreSQL (http://www.postgresql.org/)
  3. Install SQLAlchemy (http://www.sqlalchemy.org/)
     (If you run vagrant and git, you can just:
     git clone https://github.com/udacity/fullstack-nanodegree-vm.git fullstack)
  4. Download the contents of this repo.
  5. Open command prompt.
  6. cd [directory of repo clone] && python tournament_test.py
  7. The file should run 8 tests, and print "Success! All tests pass!"
  8. Peek inside tournament.py
  9. Profit!
